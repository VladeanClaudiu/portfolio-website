                <p>
                    I'm a Frontend / React Developer, 
                    I am passionate about creating interactive web apps alongside 
                    problem-solving and learning new technologies by testing myself 
                    and developing personal projects in my free time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I aim to make my code as reusable as possible and  I enjoy working with CSS due to my love for design and typography.
                </p>
